        Step 1. Identify Dead-Ends:
           - Traverse through the maze grid and identify all cells that are dead-ends.

           - Exclude the source and destination cells from being marked as dead-ends.

           - For each identified dead-end, trace back towards the nearest junction (a cell with more than one open path).
           - As you trace back, mark each cell as a non-path cell until you reach the junction.
           - This step effectively "fills in" dead-end paths that cannot lead to the destination.

           - After processing all dead-ends, mark only the cells that are not part of the non-path set as valid path cells.
           - These cells are considered part of the solution and will be marked as visited.
